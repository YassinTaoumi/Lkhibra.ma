Create a vehicule class that has : name, max_speed, color , capacity
and create a method that prints the following message : 
The seating capacity of a name is capacity passengers
"""

"""
Create a Bus child class that inherits from the Vehicle class. 
The default fare charge of any vehicle is seating capacity * 100. 
If Vehicle is Bus instance, we need to add an extra 10% on full fare as a maintenance charge. 
So total fare for bus instance will become the final amount = total fare + 10% of the total fare.
Note: The bus seating capacity is 50. so the final fare amount should be 5500. 
You need to override the fare() method of a Vehicle class in Bus class.

Create an instance from the vehicule class and call the methods of this class for this object

"""
Make a class called User . Create two attributes called first_name
and last_name , and then create several other attributes that are typically stored
in a user profile. Make a method called describe_user() that prints a summary
of the userâ€™s information. Make another method called greet_user() that prints
a personalized greeting to the user.
Create several instances representing different users, and call both methods
for each user.
