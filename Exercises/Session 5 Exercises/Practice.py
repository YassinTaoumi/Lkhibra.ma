"""
Make a class called Restaurant . The __init__() method for
Restaurant should store two attributes: a restaurant_name and a cuisine_type .
Make a method called describe_restaurant() that prints these two pieces of
information, and a method called open_restaurant() that prints a message indi-
cating that the restaurant is open.
Make an instance called restaurant from your class. Print the two attri-
butes individually, and then call both methods.
--> Create three different instances from the class, and call describe_restaurant() for each
instance

"""
Start with your program from the above exercise.
Add an attribute called number_served with a default value of 0. Create an
instance called restaurant from this class. Print the number of customers the
restaurant has served, and then change this value and print it again.
Add a method called set_number_served() that lets you set the number
of customers that have been served. Call this method with a new number and
print the value again.
Add a method called increment_number_served() that lets you increment
the number of customers who’ve been served. Call this method with any num-
ber you like that could represent how many customers were served in, say, a
day of business.
